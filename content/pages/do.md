A short selection of the classically productive things I like to do to pass time, express myself, and make bank.

(Scroll down a little if you're here because you might like to hire me ;))

## Writing

In truth my 'Me' page should really just redirect to a random selection of my writing, as that is where you'll find my soul. It's my main form of creative expression.

It's also the hardest, most terrifying, and most rewarding thing I do.

My major project right now is a modern take on Milton's Paradise Lost. It's set in a version of Heaven not too dissimilar from our Earth, where God sits in judgment but has little interest in defining the parameters of that judgment -- He leaves that up to His subjects. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Heavenly civilisation is falling into decline, and its people (angels?) are eager for a strong, charismatic leader to restore its former glory.

It may take the tiniest little bit of inspiration from recent world events.

I can't really say what my stories are about, other than that they're about power.

I love to explore:

- the ways in which we relate to one another and their consequences
- the ways in which we repress our own basic nature, and the ways in which that makes us susceptible to manipulation and control
- the ways in which others might seek to manipulate and control us (and in which they often succeed!)

You can find a selection of my writing [here](/), and a snippet from the Paradise Lost project [here](/posts/justice-in-an-unjust-world).

## Coding

I spent years working with relational databases in the corporate world until I decided to get serious about building the full stack. Coding is now a genuine love of mine.

You'll find a few of my projects below:

###### Personal Site

My most recent project is a lightning fast personal blog site (built using [gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org)) to house some of my work. You can find it [here](/).

###### Website for Get Product People GmbH

[This one's](https://getproductpeople.com/) another gatsby project (it was my first time using the technology). It's a business website for a friend who works in product development. Click the image to visit the site.

###### Franchise Reporting Platform

My most substantial project yet is a reporting app built for my a friend's home maintenance business.

The dream is to turn this into a platform which can relatively readily provide reporting for franchises (and their franchisees).

It looks deceptively simple from here, but check it out:

This one's gone through quite an evolution:

It started off as a couple of google forms spitting out into a google sheet with array formulas for calulated fields, and a sheets dashboard with a few tables calculating summary statistics.

From there I built a nodejs server with a front-end which generates forms from JSON and a template (I did this to enable easy deployment of similar for other businesses - you can see the output above).

When it eventually became clear that Google Sheets was utterly untenable as a Database layer I plugged in a PostgreSQL db.

I haven't quite found the time to switch the Data Studio reports to read from the DB, but it's on the backlog and I can't wait to get rid of the sheets layer (though the DB is currently the source of truth).

I'd also love to rebuild the front end with a framework. I built the entire form-builder engine with jQuery and vanilla JS and it's a nightmare to maintain. It was useful to go through the pain of not using a framework I guess - it really taught me their value.

## Organising

It's funny the things we learn about ourselves as we grow a little older. I would never have guessed a few years ago that I'd get a massive kick out of organising decentralised non-profit community spaces, but there you go. My love for organising started in the Burner community. [The constraints imposed by that culture](https://burningman.org/culture/philosophical-center/10-principles/) and the vibe it attracts create a space from which very pure and consensual hierarchies tend to emerge. Working within these hierarchies, while intimidating and demanding, is just about the best feeling I've ever experienced. Low ego with high support, clarity with compassion, and a beautiful blend of responsible space holding with an open and experimental attitude (most of the time). In my experience this is humanity at its best. My most recent foray into Burn Organising is [Home Burn Berlin](https://www.facebook.com/Home-Burn-Berlin-102075708068069), a 'radically decentralised' (if we want to get wanky with our lingo) experiment in bridging the gap between the big, occasional, inaccessible burning man events around the world and everyday life. [Contact me](/pages/contact) if you'd like to know more.

Burn (event) spaces are inherently transient. Their impermanenence supports a ripe environment for experimentation and play as we don't have to live with the consequences of our decisions (or one another!) for very long. However this also makes them a little bit less than reflective of reality. I find myself drawn to the challenges of creating a more structured and permanent space. I find that this requires more patience and consideration, and the development of longer-term working relationships with my co-organisers, and it feels like that benefits me. My most recent engagement in this area is to [a self-organising non-profit co-working/community space](https://www.coopspace.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FlyerCoopspace_.pdf) in Berlin:
