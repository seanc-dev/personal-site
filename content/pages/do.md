A short selection of the classically productive things I like to do to pass time, express myself, and make bank:

## Writing

The hardest, most terrifying, and most rewarding thing I do.

In truth my 'Me' page should really just redirect to a random selection of my writing, as that is where you'll find my soul. It's my main form of creative expression.

My major project right now is a modern take on Milton's Paradise Lost. It's set in a version of Heaven not too dissimilar from our Earth, where God sits in judgment but has little interest in defining the parameters of that judgment -- He leaves that up to His subjects. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Heavenly civilisation is falling into decline, and its people (angels?) are eager for a strong, charismatic leader to restore its former glory.

It may take the tiniest little bit of inspiration from recent world events.

I can't really say what my stories are about, other than that they're about power.

I love to explore:

- the ways in which we relate to one another and their consequences
- the ways in which we repress our own basic nature, and the ways in which that makes us susceptible to manipulation and control
- the ways in which others might seek to manipulate and control us (and in which they often succeed!)

You can find a selection of my writing [here](/), and a snippet from the Paradise Lost project [here](/posts/justice-in-an-unjust-world).

## Coding

You can check out my most recent project, a lightning fast personal blog site (built using [gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org)) to house some of my projects [here](/).

[This one's](https://getproductpeople.com/) another gatsby project, my first time using the technology. It's a business website for a friend who works in product development.

My most substantial project yet is a reporting app built for my parents' business. It takes a JSON input file to generate forms on the front-end, sends data to a nodejs server which splits it out and stores it in a 5NF postgresql relational database and a google sheet. From there a Google Data Studio report accesses it (the sheets part is a bit ugly, but it's a work in progress - it isn't super low-effort to migrate data sources in GDS - and the database is the source of truth).
