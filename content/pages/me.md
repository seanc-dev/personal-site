## Nice to meet you!

### Who am I?

Great question.

Benjamin Franklin once said that, along with Steel and a Diamond, Self-knowledge is one of the hardest things there is. But here goes.

I'm just another human trying to get along in this mad world. Doing my what I can to do and be better each day, to live well, eat better, and love best.

I grew up in/near Wellington, New Zealand. I live in Kreuzberg, Berlin.

I particularly love cheese of various kinds, fried chicken, and a good burger (preferably with beetroot and a fried egg #kiwiburger). I love to climb things and walk long distances. I like my own company better than most.

I'm interested in finding and speaking truth, in telling stories, in experiencing quality and appreciating beauty, and in leaving this world better than I found it.

And I'm happy to laugh at almost anything.

### What do I do?

I like to explore power and the ways in which we use it and allow ourselves to be subject to it.

I do this primarily by [writing stories](/pages/do/).

I also do this by organising things. OK, not just any old things. [Burning Man things](https://burningman.org/culture/philosophical-center/10-principles/), and [this thing](https://www.coopspace.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FlyerCoopspace_.pdf).

One more thing which I like doing is building things. You can find some of the things I've built [here](/pages/do/).
