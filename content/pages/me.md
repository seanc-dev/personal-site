### Nice to meet you.

I like to explore power and the ways in which we allow ourselves to be subject to it.

I do this primarily by writing stories.

I can't really say what my stories are about, other than that they're about power. I love to explore the ways we relate to one another and the consequences they create. I love to explore the ways we repress our own basic nature, and the ways in which that makes us susceptible to manipulation and control. I love to explore the ways in which others seek to manipulate and control us.

My major project right now is a modern take on Milton's Paradise Lost. It's set in a version of Heaven not too dissimilar from our Earth, where God sits in judgment but has little interest in defining the parameters of that judgment -- He leaves that up to His subjects. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Heavenly civilisation is falling into decline, and its people (angels?) are eager for a strong, charismatic leader to restore its former glory.
