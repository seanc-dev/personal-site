A collection of some of my marketable and not-so-marketable skills

## Coding

Building stuff! I worked with databases in my corporate life for 4 years and always found it quite satisfying that the output of my work was, at best, information in an email or a report that, typically, someone else had built. So I decided to learn how to build the whole lot myself.

### Languages and frameworks:

Javascript is my web-dev language of choice.

I've built web-apps using the following javascript tech:

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org)
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)

Plus a whole bunch of little bits and pieces which aren't really worth mentioning here. At this point I'm quite confident that if your project fits within the above list, I can build it. If it doesn't, then please [let me know](/pages/contact) so that I can know what to learn next!

I have extensive experience with database design and query optimistation:

- 4 years experience in database marketing teams in banking and tech
- Designed and managed data flows into and out of the marketing automation engine (Marketo) for a \$4bn multinational tech company, for consumption in our markets around the world.
- Designed and built 5NF production database for [NodeJS web app](/pages/do#franchisereportingplatform).

## Product Management

At [Xero.com](https://www.xero.com/), from mid 2016-18, I managed our global implementation of [Marketo](https://www.marketo.com/), during which time we won [Marketo's Globe Trotter Award](https://www.xero.com/blog/2017/04/marketo-globe-trotter-award/) for best global rollout of the platform.

My role was a composite one: to manage the operations of the platform, to consult with the business and, through understanding their needs, build the platform development roadmap, and to work with delivery resource to deliver that roadmap.

I'm a very effective people leader, I speak business and techie, and I'm capable of understanding and synthesising various strategic priorities to make the best decision for my team or domain. I'm also very comfortable saying no.
