description: "An ancient angelic prosecutor laments the difficulty of bringing evil-doers to justice and the surprising lack of assistance he receives in that endeavour from the 'morally perfect' judge."

"Madam Witch," began the prosecutor in the weary tones of an ageing public servant who, after so many years of service, very rarely finds himself surprised. "Are you honestly going to sit here and tell the court that you had a contractual right to eat those two children? May I remind you that you are under oath - _and that the Judge is omniscient?_"

"Look! 'ere it is! Righ' 'ere!" the old hag contended, "art'cle 17, clause four! Righ' 'ere in plain papyrus! I've got copies if ye need 'em!" insisted the witch, waving a bound sheaf of parchment at him.

Taking the parchment without bothering to shift his expression of weary scepticism, the prosecutor craned his head back slightly. Peering at it through the half-moon spectacles perched at the end of his nose, he read:

"The occupant at.." he paused, squinting to read the handwritten address "..' number six Gingerbread Lane has the unencumbered right to consume, wholly or in part, the body, soul and/or eternal ethereal essence, of any being who sees fit to break off a portion of the property at the aforementioned address, without the express permission of the occupant, and to eat it'".

The prosecutor was already short on patience. Traffic was so bad in the jet-stream this morning that he'd been forced to battle through one of the lesser currents to the office - he'd have enjoyed the exercise in his younger years, but there was somewhat more of him now, and rather less of it was muscle. As it were, the amount of flapping required to keep him aloft, let alone to ascend to the courts in the upper echelons, was.. well, it was a rather tiresome and sweaty business. And it now appeared that his open-and-shut attempted cannibalism case was swinging in the attempted cannibal's favour. Some days he just didn't know why he left the comfort of his armchair, his morning cup of tea in one hand and the early edition of The Holy Herald upright in the other.

"I.. have no further questions your honour" the prosecutor sighed and turned away from The Witch. Why was it that the agents of darkness were always such fastidious record keepers?

Upon returning to his seat the prosecutor became aware that the court would be adjourned for a short recess, during which the Judge would deliberate and decide upon The Witch's guilt. He'd never really understood the need for such breaks. Surely a being who existed outside of time and space had no need of 'a moment to think'? Surely if He cared so much about keeping up appearances, He would vocalise such pronouncements (as would any corporeal judge). Instead, He preferred to simply make His will known. But, still, process was process, and there was about as much point in fighting it as there was in trying to know the mind of God. He'd thought that a rather clever joke when he'd first conjured it, and often relayed it to the other prosecutors when they complained of the court's rigid scheduling, though it seemed to receive a more subdued response now than in eons past.

No sooner had the prosecutor reached his feet than he became aware that the Judge had reached a ruling. Along with his apparent love of due process, the Judge liked to tease those who served him with gentle reminders of the arbitrariness of the parameters of their existence and of the limitlessness of His. It would seem, in this case, that almost immediately following the imposition of an unnecessary delay for "deliberation" with the transmission of the outcome of that deliberation was intended as a playful "elbow in the ribs". Something to keep them from thinking they might actually understand his ineffable ways, the prosecutor did not doubt. Of course, this supposition had not been arrived at by a process of reasoning (if it were the Almighty would no doubt have delivered another unexpected twist to keep him guessing). No, this was more of a "rising awareness". It came to him in much the same way all such Divine Pronouncements did - the same way in which his awareness of the trial's outcome, the source of the not-insignificant amount of bile rising in the back of his throat, came to him a moment later.

The grand unfairness of it all, and perhaps a little bit the bile too, made him gag. Those poor children: abandoned by poverty-stricken parents and left to fend for themselves in the wilderness, only to be caught in an evil-intentioned old hag's honeypot. They were only defending themselves, and now they were going to be hauled up here on a mere technicality - on a few lines in a landowner's agreement - for a trial they may very well lose. He could only hope he would not be called upon to carry the case against them.

It was after dusk by the time the weary prosecutor made it home. "Home" was a cottage in a sleepy little hamlet well beyond the pearly gates. While his salary would have been enough to quite comfortably afford something inside the city limits, he rather enjoyed leaving the energy of the city for the simplicity of country life each evening. With this sentiment in mind, he alighted on the tuft of cloud which constituted the start of his garden path, let out a short sigh of contented relief, and made his way inside.

A rather bland and uneventful afternoon had followed the challenging morning. The prosecutor had made a point of actively avoiding any news of the children's trial, burying himself in busywork, and this endeavour appeared to have been successful. It wasn't that he disagreed with the ruling - how could he? - it was just that 'justice' in the Kingdom of Heaven could at times look more like cold cruelty than anything resembling equity. It had a way of weighing on you after a while.

"I just don't understand why you're getting yourself all worked up over nothing" the prosecutor's wife called from the kitchen. He had settled into his armchair next to the fire and set about stuffing his pipe with tobacco leaf as she busied herself in the kitchen. "The Lord works in mysterious ways they say, and I'd wager there are few as mysterious as contract law". His wife was a kindly yet direct woman of some half dozen fewer years than her husband. She had the bustling competence of a career homemaker and the curious mix of maternal instinct and no-nonsense attitude only seen in those who've raised several children largely on their own. She challenged him and loved him, and he her, in equal measure.

"Yes yes, I know, all-knowing all-powerful and all of that. It's not that I doubt the judgement - or the process for that matter - it's just-" the prosecutor paused to light his pipe and take a puff, "I'm just not really sure that I feel like I really matter in any of it anymore". He exhaled, looking as though something more than just smoke was leaving him as he continued. "I'm not really sure that I'm making a difference".

"Oh hosh posh!" dismissed his wife, carrying their dinner trays into the living room and setting his on his lap. "There was that young blonde girl on the breaking and entering charge wasn't there? You remember her. Wandered off in a fugue state and pinched some porridge and a nap? You convinced Grizz and his family to drop charges and got her the care she needed, all while the higher-ups were leaning on you to take a hard line". She settled into her own chair across from him. "And that ghastly girl with the red cape. Did away with her granny and tried to frame that innocent wolf. Had everyone else fooled she did. If it weren't for you she'd be on some tropical beach by now, living it up large on her inheritance."

"Come now, how anyone thought a wolf could have believably impersonated her Grandmother I'll never know" the prosecutor protested, though his chest had puffed up ever so slightly at her words.

"The point is," she continued, through a mouthful of Shepherd's Pie "that your job is not to worry about the meaning of it all. Leave that to Him - the Lord knows He's the only one with a hope of answering that question. No, your job is to do your best, at all times, even when you don't feel like that's very much. Do that, dear, and justice will be done. Now, if you're done with the existential anguish for the evening, I would like to watch the news".

She was right, thought the prosecutor. It was hardly surprising: one of the at-times frustrating aspects of being an angel (not to mention being married to one) was that it could be quite a challenge to speak anything but the truth. Still, though, her words were a great comfort to him as he sat there contentedly munching on his shepherd's pie and turned his attention to the TV.

He was so comfortable, in fact, that he did not immediately recognise the familiar face accompanying the bulletin for the night's headline story, entitled "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner?":

_"Hansel and Grettel were found guilty this afternoon of wanton destruction (and consumption) of property, with the Almighty ruling in favour of The Witch's contractual rights to consume them, body and soul. This after the prosecution failed to press their case earlier in the day for what many experts had called 'an open-and-shut-case' of attempted cannibalism. You won't have to miss a moment of the action: we're coming to you live from 5 Gingerbread Lane as the children pay their dues."_
